    `Um al-Kheir is a small shepherding community in the South Hebron Hills. For decades, its buildings have been subject to demolition orders. In the winter of 2022, Haj Suleiman, the village's 73-year-old elder, tried to peacefully stop an Israeli police truck which had come to the village to confiscate unregistered cars. The truck crushed him and he died of his wounds several days <a

    In the summer of 2024, against a backdrop of settler violence, Israeli forces entered the village a number of times to carry out demolitions. Awdah Hathaleen, another activist from the village, watched as the Israeli military headed straight to the tent of the late Haj Suleiman and bulldozed it. They then proceeded to demolish more homes, the village's council tent, and its solar electricity infrastructure.

The older members of the family have tried to shield their young from sights of demolition and settler attacks, but it's impossible to avoid. Awdah's 4-year-old son now carries memories of violence with him. Since the summer, he's developed a stutter. Doctors say the best treatment for stuttering is a safe environment, but his village remains slated for further <a

    `Al-Walajah is one of many Palestinian communities in and around Jerusalem whose fate is uncertain. Since 1967, when Israel annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank, Israeli authorities never made a zoning plan Al-Walajah. Therefore, it's impossible for residents there to build legally.

    `Kahn al-Ahmar is nestled between Jerusalem and the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim. It's home to a few hundred Bedouins, who moved to the area after being expelled from Israel's Negev desert in the 1950s. In 2018, The Israeli Supreme Court greenlit the eviction of all Kahn al-Ahmar's residents, on the grounds that the village was built on state-owned land, through construction without <a

    Eviction hasn't happened yet, due to pressure from local activists and the international community. The European Union has announced unequivocal opposition to the eviction, making it politically difficult for the Israeli government to <a

          </a> But the village is still considered illegal by Israeli authorities, and its members live in constant fear of demolition. Mohammad Abu Eid Jahalin, a 53-year old resident, has said that pressure on the village has increased in recent years. Israeli authorities have revoked all work permits for men in the village, making it hard for them to earn a living. Settlers have established a new outpost just a few dozen meters away from the village. At night they shine flashlights into the villagers' homes, and in the morning they throw stones to prevent the village's children from taking their usual route to <a

          </a> Jahalin says that building anything new in the village has become impossible too: “We are being watched all the time by drones that film everything we do, and we are not allowed to bring in any building materials or equipment. If one of us sets up a new tent it will be demolished the next <a

    `'Ein Samia used to be a Palestinian village of around 200 residents, a little northeast of Ramallah. As of 2023, it no longer exists. For years, the Israeli military demolished homes in the village, and banned any infrastructure development. Villagers weren't allowed to connect to water or sewage systems. This pressure from the military, combined with increasingly violent attacks from settlers, made life unbearable. Mohammed Haseen, a representative of the village's residents, described the dynamic this way: “The State of Israel completely denies our existence. They destroy our homes, deny us electricity, and even tell us that they will demolish our elementary school. On the mountain across from the village, we can see the large houses made of concrete that belong to the settlers. We can see them from our tents and our houses made of tin. We can see that they get electricity and water and whatever they want from the <a

    Residents of the community were forced to flee in May of 2023. Some families simply packed their things into tractors and left without a destination, not knowing where to go. `,
