            Area C of the West Bank is completely controlled by the Israeli military. It's home to 300,000 Palestinians and 400,000 Israeli settlers. 
            <br /><br />
            Palestinians in Area C must receive building permits from the Israeli military in order to legally build homes, schools, and other buildings. Here you can see how many permits the military has granted Palestinian residents over the last decade.

            While Palestinians only secure a handful of permits every year, the Israeli settlers who live alongside them receive thousands.

            Palestinians' lack of permits isn't for lack of trying. They've submitted thousands of applications to build on their land, which are represented as tiles here. 
            <br /><br />
            In theory, there's more than enough space to accomodate construction. Area C is relatively vast, constituting 61% of all land  in the West Bank. However Israel only allows Palestinians to apply for permits on 0.6% of Area C's land, leaving much of the land zoned for Israeli <a

            And even within these narrow geographic confines, the Israeli military still rejects nearly all Palestinian applications. By their own admission, this is part of a deliberate plan to discourage Palestinian life in the region.

            Without permits, Palestinians have no choice but to build illegally. The Israeli military, in turn, is empowered to demolish these buildings on the grounds that they're unlawfully constructed. Every year, the military demolishes thousands of buildings under these pretenses, erasing homes and communities throughout Area C.

          This process of home demolition can feel Kafkaesque. Palestinians, who are de facto barred from receiving permits, are considered to be acting unlawfully when they build without them. The permitting regime in Area C leaves them in an impossible position: follow the rules, and you can't build a roof over your head. Disobey the rules, and the military may render you homeless anyway.

          In these nine tiles are the stories of just a few of the thousands of Palestinians who have suffered from demolition.
          <br /><br />
          Many have watched helplessly as the military destroyed their homes, schools, water storage, and electricity infrastructure. Some have been peacefully protesting against demolition for decades, but that itself is a dangerous proposition, since protesting requires a permit from an Israeli military

          Under all this pressure, some communities have been forced to abandon their land entirely.
