            Area C of the West Bank is completely controlled by the Israeli military. It's home to 300,000 Palestinians and 400,000 Israeli settlers. 
            <br /><br />
            Palestinians in Area C must receive building permits from the Israeli military's Civil Administration in order to legally build their homes, schools, and other structures. Here you can see how many permits the military has granted Palestinian residents over the last decade.

            Palestinians' lack of permits isn't for lack of trying. They've submitted thousands of applications to build on their land, which are represented as tiles here. 
            <br /><br />
            In theory, there's more than enough space to accomodate construction. Area C is relatively vast, constituting 61% of all land  in the West Bank. However Israel only allows Palestinians to apply for permits on 0.6% of Area C's land, leaving much of the rest zoned for Israeli <a

            <br /><br />
            The policy guiding this huge disparity may be Israel's effort to promote Jewish settlement and exclusive sovereignty over the West Bank. These principles were articulated decades ago in the platform of the Likud - Israel's most dominant parliamentary <a

            Without permits, Palestinians have no choice but to build illegally. The Israeli military, in turn, is empowered to demolish these buildings on the grounds that they're unlawfully constructed. Every year, the military demolishes thousands of buildings under these pretenses, erasing homes and communities throughout Area C.

          This process of home demolition can feel Kafkaesque. Palestinians, who are effectively barred from receiving permits, are considered to be acting unlawfully when they build without them. The permitting regime leaves them in an impossible position: follow the rules, and you can't build a roof over your head. Disobey the rules, and the military may render you homeless anyway.

          In these tiles are the stories of just a few of the thousands who have suffered from demolition.
          <br /><br />
          Many have watched helplessly as the military destroyed their homes, schools, water storage, and electricity infrastructure. Some have peacefully protested against demolition for decades, but that itself is a risky proposition, since protesting requires a permit from an Israeli military

          <p class="methodology-text">Data on home demolitions was sourced from B'tselem's <a href="https://statistics.btselem.org/en/intro/demolitions">database</a>. Data on Palestinian and Israeli permits was sourced from <a href="https://peacenow.org.il/en/settlements-watch/settlements-data/construction">Peace Now</a>. Home demolition latitude and longitude coordinates were inferred through a few methods: if the demolition village was logged in OCHA's <a href = "https://data.humdata.org/dataset/state-of-palestine-admin-level-2-boundaries/resource/1936b09f-74a8-4d4d-b92b-2ee75abb21f1">communities database</a>, coordinates from that database were used. If the village didn't appear in the database, the village's name was plugged into the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview">Google Maps Geocoding API</a>, and its latitude and longitude coordinates were extracted that way. If the Geocoding API didn't return a result, or returned a result that was outside the West Bank, latitude and longitude coordinates were manually assigned by checking for a village's location on <a href="https://www.btselem.org/map">B'tselem's interactive map</a>, and then identifying that same location on Google Maps. 

          <br /><br />
          The curved lines used to represent Israeli settler permits were inspired by W.E.B Du Bois's data portraits, which used snaking lines to represent outliers in a dataset. You can view an example <a href="https://fisherdigitus.library.utoronto.ca/files/original/826e6a4e345931684ffa77453307d8fc.jpg">here</a>.

          Much of the imagery and stories used in this project were sourced from Ha'aretz, +972 Magazine, B'tselem, and Al Jazeera, and specifically from the work of Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham.
